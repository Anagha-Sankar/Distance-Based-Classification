  #### Description

  This project uses different distance metrics to classify the iris dataset. Also, aims to compare the performance of different distance metrics in terms of Misclassification Error Rate and Accuracy.

  #### Requirement

  1. Python 3
  2. Jupyter Notebook
  3. Numpy
  4. Pandas
  5. Matplotlib

  #### Installation

  1. **Python**

     - Visit and download Python from https://www.python.org/downloads/

     - Install and add Python to path

       ```
       python3 -V
       ```

       Install pip

       ```
       sudo apt install python3-pip
       ```

  2. **Numpy**

     Using pip,

     ```
     pip install numpy
     ```

  3. **Pandas**

     In command line, change directory to where pip is present

     ```
     pip install pandas
     ```

  5. **Jupyter notebook**

     Install the classic Jupyter Notebook using:

     ```
     pip install notebook
     ```

     To run the notebook

     ```
     jupyter notebook
     ```

  5. **Matplotlib**

     In command line, change directory to where pip is present

     ```
     pip install -U matplotlib
     ```
